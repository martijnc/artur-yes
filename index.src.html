Introduction {#intro}
============

Cross-site scripting is a problem for developers. Despite the existence of context-aware escaping
mechanisms in templating systems, content injection continues to be one of of the most common
attack vectors.

Content Security Policy [[CSP]] aims to reduce the risk of these attacks, and is widely supported
by browsers. It has proven to be difficult to deploy, however, as the syntax is complicated, the
overriding rules are confused, and the feature itself serves several different purposes. Recent
research has shown flaws in real-world deployments result in policies that are ineffective at
directly preventing cross-site scripting in the overwhelming majority of cases [[CSP-IS-DEAD]].
That research, and related discussions, has lead to new approaches within CSP (like those
described in [[CSP3#strict-dynamic-usage]]) which seem promising, but the syntax ends up being
somewhat verbose and the behavior confusing due to backwards compatibility concerns.

This document proposes a policy language focused strictly on XSS protection, pulling in a subset
of CSP's functionality, along with existing functionality such as that supported by the
`X-XSS-Protection` HTTP response header. The goal is to provide the same XSS mitigation guarantees
as a verbose and complicated CSP, in a pithy and comprehensible package.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to defend against cross-site scripting. It can do so by generating a unique
  string for each page load, and including that string both in an
  <a http-header>`XSS-Protection`</a> header and in the <{script}> element's <{script/nonce}>
  attribute, as follows:

  <pre highlight="yaml">
    <a http-header>XSS-Protection</a>: { "<a for="XSSProtectionPolicy" dictionary-member>nonce</a>": "<strong>abcdefg</strong>" }
  </pre>

  <pre highlight="html">
    &lt;!-- This script will execute. --&gt;
    &lt;script src="script.js" nonce="<strong>abcdefg</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;!-- This script won't (no nonce). --&gt;
    &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  </pre>

  Note: This will also have the happy side-effect of disabling plugins and enabling the user agent's
  built-in XSS protections in "blocking" mode rather than the user agent's default "filtering" mode
  for the current page. Hooray!
</div>

Framework {#framework}
=========

This specification uses terminology from [[!RFC5234]] and [[!HTTP-JFV]] to define its syntax
expectations, and relies heavily on [[!CSP]] (which itself relies on [[FETCH]] and [[HTML]]) for
enforcement.

Policy {#policy}
------

An <dfn export>XSS protection policy</dfn> defines a set of behaviors which are to be applied to
a {{Window}} or {{WorkerGlobalScope}}.

Each policy has a <dfn for="XSS protection policy">nonce</dfn> which is a string. Its value is the
empty string unless otherwise specified.

Each policy has a <dfn for="XSS protection policy">hash set</dfn> which is a set of strings. Its
value is the empty set unless otherwise specified.

Each policy has a <dfn for="XSS protection policy">reporting group</dfn> which is a string. Its
value is the string "`default`" unless otherwise specified.

Each policy has a <dfn for="XSS protection policy">reflection policy</dfn> which is one of
"`ignore`", "`filter`", or "`block`". Its value is "`block`" unless otherwise specified.

Algorithms {#algorithms}
----------

<h4 algorithm id="policy-for-response">
  Obtain a set of XSS protection policies for |response|.
</h4>

Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm returns a sequence of <a>XSS protection
policy</a> objects. If no valid policy is found for |response|, the returned sequence will be
empty.

1.  Let |policies| be an empty sequence.

2.  Let |value| be the result of <a lt="parse a header value">parsing</a>
    "<a http-header>`XSS-Protection`</a>" in |response|'s <a for="response">header list</a>.

3.  If |value| is `null`, return |policies|.

4.  Let |list| be the result of executing the algorithm defined in Section 4 of [[!HTTP-JFV]] on
    |value|. If that algorithm results in an error, return |policies|.

5.  For each |item| in |list|:

    1.  Let |policy| be a new <a>XSS protection policy</a>.

    2.  If |item| has a {{XSSProtectionPolicy/hash}} member whose value (|value|) is a
        `sequence<DOMString>`, then for each |digest| in |value|:
        
        1.  If |digest| matches the ABNF grammar
            <code><a grammar>hash-algorithm</a>-<a grammar>hash-source</a></code> (as defined in
            [[!CSP]]), then add |digest| to |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">hash set</a>.

    3.  If |item| has a {{XSSProtectionPolicy/nonce}} member whose value (|value|) is a
        `DOMString` that matches the ABNF grammar <a grammar>`base64-value`</a> (as defined in
        [[!CSP]]), then set |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">nonce</a> to |value|.

    4.  If |item| has a {{XSSProtectionPolicy/reflection}} member whose value (|value|) is a valid
        {{ReflectedXSSPolicy}}, then set |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">reflection
        policy</a> to |value|.

    5.  If |item| has a {{XSSProtectionPolicy/report}} member whose value (|value|) matches the
        <a grammar>`token`</a> grammar (as defined in [[!RFC7230]]), then set |policy|'s
        <a for="XSS protection policy">reporting group</a> to |value|.

    6.  Append |policy| to |policies|.
    
6.  Return |policies|.


The `XSS-Protection` HTTP Response Header {#header}
=========================================

The <dfn export http-header>`XSS-Protection`</dfn> HTTP response header field is the delivery
mechanism for the mitigations this document offers. The header's value is a <dfn>serialized XSS
protection policy</dfn> represented by the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

<pre>
  XSS-Protection = <a grammar>json-field-value</a>
</pre>

<div class="example">
  <pre>
    <a http-header>XSS-Protection</a>: { "nonce": "abcdefg", "reflection": "block", "report": "group1" }
  </pre>

  This header will have more or less the same effect as delivering the following headers:

  <pre>
    <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-abcdegf';
                             object-src 'none';
                             report-to group1;
    X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block; report=group1;
  </pre>
</div>

A server MAY send different `X-XSS-Protection` header field values with different representations
of the same resource.

The header's value is interpreted as an array of JSON objects, as described in Section 4 of
[[!HTTP-JFV]]. Detailed parsing instructions are found in [[#policy-for-response]], but the syntax
boils down to a representation of the following dictionary type:

<pre class="idl">
  enum ReflectedXSSPolicy {
    "ignore",
    "filter",
    "block"
  };

  enum EvalPolicy {
    "block",
    "unsafe-allow"
  };

  dictionary XSSProtectionPolicy {
    EvalPolicy eval = "block";
    sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; hash;
    DOMString nonce;
    ReflectedXSSPolicy reflection = "block";
    DOMString report = "default";
  };
</pre>

The following subsections define the behavior of each of the known members the header's value
defines. Future versions of this document may define additional members; user agents MUST ignore
unknown members when parsing the header.

The `eval` member {#eval-member}
-----------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="XSSProtectionPolicy">eval</dfn> member defines the page's policy
towards `eval()`. By default, the value is "`block`", which causes `eval()` to throw a
`SecurityError` rather than executing a string as code. It can be set to "`unsafe-allow`" in order
to allow such conversion.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. has a number of libraries which require `eval()` for various purposes. They can
  allow such execution by sending an appropriate {{XSSProtectionPolicy/eval}} member along with
  their XSS protection policy:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>XSS-Protection</a>: { "<a for="XSSProtectionPolicy">hash</a>": [ "<strong>sha256-abcd...</strong>", "<strong>sha256-zyx...</strong>", "<a for="XSSProtectionPolicy">eval</a>": "unsafe-allow" ] }
  </pre>
</div>

The `hash` member {#hash-member}
-----------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="XSSProtectionPolicy">hash</dfn> member defines a set of digests
which specify specific script content which is allowed to execute on a given page.

If present, the member's value MUST be a sequence of {{DOMString}}s, and each MUST adhere to the
<a grammar>hash-source</a> grammar specified in [[CSP3#framework-directive-source-list]]. Any
item in the sequence that does not match that grammer MUST be ignored.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to ensure that injected <{script}> elements do not execute. They can do so
  by executing a secure hash function (like those specified in [[SHA2]]) on each script they wish to
  execute, and including the resulting list of digests in an <a http-header>`XSS-Protection`</a>
  header. These digests either match the inline content of a <{script}> element or event handler, or
  match a <{script}> element's <{script/integrity}> attribute:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>XSS-Protection</a>: { "<a for="XSSProtectionPolicy">hash</a>": [ "<strong>sha256-abcd...</strong>", "<strong>sha256-zyx...</strong>" ] }

    ...

    &lt;script src="script.js" integrity="<strong>sha256-abcd...</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      // Content which hashes to `abcd...` goes here.
    &lt;/script&gt;
    
    &lt;a onclick="// Content which hashes to `zyx...` goes here."&gt;Click!&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

ISSUE(w3c/webappsec-csp#13): Matching inline event handlers requires some changes to CSP.

ISSUE(w3c/webappsec-csp#78): Matching external scripts requires solidifying CSP's SRI integration.

The `nonce` member {#nonce-member}
------------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="XSSProtectionPolicy">`nonce`</dfn> member defines a cryptographic
nonce ("number used once") which can be used to ensure that only <{script}> elements whose
<{script/nonce}> attributes contain a specific value are allowed to execute script for a given page.

If present, the member's value MUST be a {{DOMString}}, and MUST adhere to the
<a grammar>base64-value</a> grammar specified in [[CSP3#framework-directive-source-list]]. If the
member's value does not match that grammar, the value MUST be ignored.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to ensure that injected <{script}> elements do not execute. They can do so
  by generating a unique string for each page load, and including that string both in an
  <a http-header>`XSS-Protection`</a> header and in the <{script}> element's <{script/nonce}>
  attribute, as follows:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>XSS-Protection</a>: { "<a for="XSSProtectionPolicy" dictionary-member>nonce</a>": "<strong>abcdefg</strong>" }

    ...

    &lt;script src="script.js" nonce="<strong>abcdefg</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

The `reflection` member {#reflection-member}
-----------------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="XSSProtectionPolicy">`reflection`</dfn> member controls the behavior
of any built-in mechanisms a user agent provides to actively defend against reflected cross-site
scripting. 

The known values for this member are as follows:

:   {{ReflectedXSSPolicy/ignore}}
::  Disables the user agent's active defenses against XSS.
:   {{ReflectedXSSPolicy/filter}}
::  Enables the user agent's active defenses against XSS, filtering reflected script from the page.
    This is the default behavior for most user agents that implement such protections.
:   {{ReflectedXSSPolicy/block}}
::  Enables the user agent's active defenses against XSS, blocking the page entirely if reflected
    script is detected. Generally speaking, this is safer than {{ReflectedXSSPolicy/filter}}, and
    we use it as the fallback when an <a http-header>`XSS-Protection`</a> header is delivered
    without specifying a behavior.

User agents MAY choose not to support this attribute if they do not implement such heuristics.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to ensure that the user agent's built-in XSS protection mechanisms are
  active, but does not want the browser to simply filter out suspected reflections. They prefer to
  block the page load entirely. They can do so with the following header:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>XSS-Protection</a>: { "<a for="XSSProtectionPolicy" idl>reflection</a>": "<a for="ReflectedXSSPolicy" idl>block</a>" }
  </pre>
</div>

The `report` member {#report-member}
-------------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="XSSProtectionPolicy">`report`</dfn> member defines the reporting
group to which violation reports will be sent [[REPORTING]].

The member's value MUST be a {{DOMString}}. If an empty string is provided, reporting will be
disabled.

Note: Reporting to the group named "`default`" is enabled unless otherwise specified.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to receive violation reports when script execution is blocked by the XSS
  protection policy it specifies. It can do so by sending a {{XSSProtectionPolicy/report}} member
  along with the policy, and specifying a reporting endpoint, as follows:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>XSS-Protection</a>: { "<a for="XSSProtectionPolicy" idl>nonce</a>": "abcdefg", "<a for="XSSProtectionPolicy" idl>report</a>": "group1" }
    <a http-header>Report-To</a>: { "<a spec="REPORTING">url</a>": "https://example.com/report", "<a spec="REPORTING">group</a>": "group1", "<a spec="REPORTING">max-age</a>": 10886400 }
  </pre>
</div>

Integrations {#integrations}
============

The <a http-header>`XSS-Protection`</a> header is little more than syntactic sugar on top of
existing processing algorithms for [[CSP]] and `X-XSS-Protection`. This section explains the ways
in which the <a>XSS protection policy</a> is enforced for a given context:

Integration with Fetch {#monkey-patching-fetch}
----------------------

1.  When executing [[csp3#set-response-csp-list]] (currently as step 3.3.4 of <a>HTTP fetch</a>, and
    step 12 of <a>HTTP-network fetch</a>), Fetch should also execute the algorithm defined in
    [[#set-response-csp-list]].

ISSUE: Upstream this once we decide it's sane.

<h4 algorithm id="set-response-csp-list">
  Populate |response|'s CSP list from its XSS protection policy.
</h4>

Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm modifies its <a for="response">CSP list</a> to
enforce the <a>XSS protection policy</a> it specifies.

1.  For each |policy| in the result of executing [[#policy-for-response]] on |response|:

    1.  If |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">nonce</a> is an empty string and
        |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">hash set</a> is empty, then skip the remaining
        substeps and move to the next |policy|.

    2.  Assert: |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">nonce</a> is either an empty string or
        matches the <a grammar>base64-value</a> grammar specified in [[CSP]]. Likewise, |policy|'s
        <a for="XSS protection policy">hash set</a> is either empty or all its values match the
        grammar "<a grammar>hash-algorithm</a>-<a grammar>hash-source</a>". Further, |policy|'s
        <a for="XSS protection policy">reporting group</a> is a string that matches the `token`
        grammar defined in [[RFC7230]].

    3.  Let |csp| be a new <a for="/" lt="policy">Content Security Policy</a> with an empty
        <a for="policy">directive set</a>, and a <a for="policy">disposition</a> of "`enforce`".

    4.  Let |script-src| be the string "`'strict-dynamic' `".

    5.  If |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">nonce</a> is not an empty string, append to
        |script-src| the result of replacing "`%s`" in the string "`'nonce-%s'` " with |policy|'s
        <a for="XSS protection policy">nonce</a>.

    6.  For each |digest| in |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">hash set</a>:

        1.  Append to |script-src| the result of replacing "`%s`" in the string "`'%s'` " with
            |digest|.

    7.  Add a new <a>directive</a> to |csp|'s <a for="policy">directive set</a> whose
        <a for="directive">name</a> is "`script-src`", and whose <a for="directive">value</a> is
        |script-src|.

    8.  Add a new <a>directive</a> to |csp|'s <a for="policy">directive set</a> whose
        <a for="directive">name</a> is "`object-src`", and whose <a for="directive">value</a> is
        "`'none'`".

        ISSUE: This probably needs to be somehow configurable.

    9.  If |policy| has a <a for="XSS protection policy">reporting group</a> (|group|) which is not
        an empty string, then add a <a>directive</a> to |csp| whose <a for="directive">name</a>
        is "`report-to`", and whose <a for="directive">value</a> is |group|.

    10. Append |policy| to |response|'s <a for="response">CSP list</a>.


Integration with HTML {#monkey-patching-html}
---------------------

1.  Each {{Document}} has a <dfn for="Document">reflected XSS policy</dfn>, which is one of
    `null`, "`ignore`", "`filter`", or "`block`". The value is `null` unless otherwise specified.

2.  When executing [[csp3#initialize-document-csp]] (currently step 8 of the <a>initializing a new
    `Document` object</a> algorithm), HTML should also execute the algorithm defined in
    [[#initialize-document-xss]].

ISSUE: Upstream this once we decide it's sane.

<h4 algorithm id="initialize-document-xss">
  Initialize a `Document`'s reflected XSS policy.
</h4>

Given a {{Document}} (|document|), and a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm sets
|document|'s <a for="Document">reflected XSS policy</a> based on |response|'s
<a http-header>`XSS-Protection`</a> and `X-XSS-Protection` headers.

1.  Let |list| be an empty sequence.

2.  Append the result of executing [[#parse-x-xss-protection]] on |response| to |list|.

3.  For each |policy| in the result of executing [[#policy-for-response]] on |response|,
    append |policy|'s <a for="XSS protection policy">reflection policy</a> to |list|.

4.  Let |result| be `null`.

5.  For each |item| in |list|:

    1.  If |item| is "`block`", set |result| to "`block`".

    2.  If |item| is "`filter`", and |result| is not "`block`", set |result| to "`filter`".

    3.  If |item| is "`ignore`", and |result| is not "`block`" or "`filter`", set |result| to
        "`ignore`".

6.  Set |document|'s <a for="Document">reflected XSS policy</a> to |result|.

<h4 algorithm id="parse-x-xss-protection">
  Parse |response|'s `X-XSS-Protection` header value.
</h4>

Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm returns `null`, "`ignore`", "`filter`", or
"`block`" based on the value (or absence) of its `X-XSS-Protection` header:

1.  Let |value| be the result of <a lt="parse a header value">parsing</a> "`X-XSS-Protection`" in
    |response|'s <a for="response">header list</a>.

2.  If |value| is `null`, return `null`.

3.  Let |list| be the result of <a lt="strictly split a string">strictly splitting</a> |value| on
    U+003B SEMICOLON ("`;`").

4.  Let |result| be "`filter`".

5.  Let |processedFirstItem| be `false`.

6.  While |list| is not empty:

    1.  Let |item| be the result of popping the first item off of |list|.

    2.  <a>Strip leading and trailing whitespace</a> from |item|.

    3.  If |processedFirstItem| is `false`:

        1.  If the first character of |value| is "`0`", return "`ignore`".

        2.  If the first character of |value| is not "`1`", set |result| to "`filter`".

        3.  Set |processedFirstItem| to `true`.

        Otherwise:

        1.  If |value| is "`mode=block`", set |result| to "`block`". 

7.  Return |result|.

ISSUE: Work in progress. This isn't specified anywhere, so I'm eyeballing/simplifying Blink's
implementation. It might or might not match Edge.

Implementation Considerations {#implementation}
=============================

Error Messages {#error-messages}
--------------

The <a http-header>`XSS-Protection`</a> mechanism is defined almost entirely in terms of [[CSP]].
This is intentional, as it means that user agents can easily reuse all the existing machinery
they've built up for that purpose. It might be confusing for developers, however, especially if,
in the distant future, CSP becomes an esoteric thing that no one uses on its own. Error messages,
in particular, might be confusing if they contain the synthesized CSP headers rather than the
headers the developer actually sent.

That is, violation report console messages might look something like "Refused to execute inline
event handler because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: '`script-src
'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-abcdefg'` ...". That is <em>technically</em> accurate (the best kind of
accurate), but not particularly helpful.

User agents SHOULD ensure that the source of the policy is clear when triggering violations.

ISSUE: Perhaps we should even extend the {{SecurityPolicyViolationEvent}} and corresponding
violation report?

Acknowledgements {#acks}
================

This proposal arose from a conversation in the WebAppSec meetings at TPAC 2016. Thanks to Artur
Janc for being a good sport about the original name (the lovingly backronymed "Anti-XSS
Response-Time Uniqueness Requirement"), to Richard Barnes for being appropriately skeptical at the
value provided, and to Sebastian Lekies and Krzysztof Kotowicz for being CSP gadflies in the most
honorably Socratic tradition.
